# 🌿 AyurSutra

**The Smart Management Platform for Panchakarma Wellness**

---

> A lightweight SaaS-style web application prototype to digitize and streamline Panchakarma therapy management for Ayurvedic centres. AyurSutra bridges traditional Ayurvedic practice and modern clinic management with role-based access, session tracking, visual analytics and digital patient records.

## Demo

**Live demo:** *[AyurSutra](https://ayursutra-hackops.vercel.app/)*

---

## Overview

Many Ayurvedic centres still operate with manual, paper-based Panchakarma workflows. AyurSutra is a prototype web app that automates the therapy lifecycle with: role-based authentication for doctors and patients, session tracking, digital patient records, booking & appointment flows and visual analytics to help practitioners optimise care delivery.

This repository contains a prototype built for speed and reliability at demo time using mocked data (no production DB included in this prototype).

---

## Key Features

### For Practitioners & Doctors

* **Smart Dashboard** — visual analytics of patient flow and therapy statuses (Chart.js)
* **Therapy Management** — track ongoing Panchakarma sessions in real-time
* **Patient Records** — digital history of treatments, notes and prescriptions

### For Patients

* **Seamless Booking** — simple appointment scheduling interface
* **Treatment Tracking** — view progress for ongoing therapies
* **Health History** — access past prescriptions and wellness reports

### Security & Access (Prototype)

* Role-based authentication (Patient vs Doctor)
* Session management via `Flask-Session`
* Mocked/dummy data for stable demo deployments (no production DB included)

## Tech Stack

| Component  | Technologies / Notes                  |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Frontend   | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js       |
| Backend    | Python 3.8+, Flask                    |
| Data       | Mocked JSON / Python dict (prototype) |
| Deployment | Vercel (serverless entrypoint)        |

---

## Installation & Setup

> These instructions are for local development/testing only (prototype). The project uses mocked data to ensure stable demos without database dependencies.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Git

### Local setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/The-HackOps/AyurSutra.git
cd AyurSutra

# 2. Create a virtual environment
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the application
python run.py
```

After launching, open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:5001` (default for this prototype).

---

## Usage

* Use the role-based demo credentials (below) to log in as a Patient or Doctor.
* Explore the dashboards, create or view mocked therapy sessions, and check visual analytics.

---

## Login Credentials (Prototype)

> For the SIH 2025 demo the app ships with mocked users so deployments remain stable without a SQL backend.

* **Patient**

  * Email: `patient@test.com`
  * Password: `123`

* **Doctor / Practitioner**

  * Email: `doctor@test.com`
  * Password: `123`

*Note:* The current prototype uses mocked data for reliable demos. If you want DB-backed deployments, add a secure database (Postgres / MySQL) and update the configuration and `auth.py` accordingly.

---

## Future Scope

* **AI Integration:** Analyze patient `Prakriti` (body type) using ML models and provide decision support for personalized Panchakarma protocols.
* **IoT Integration:** Connect wearables to stream real-time vitals during therapy sessions.
* **Telemedicine:** Integrated video consultation feature for remote follow-ups and consultations.
* **Persistent DB:** Migrate from mocked data to a secure, audited database with role-based data encryption and backups.
* **Audit & Compliance:** Add logging, audit trails and role-based data access for practical clinic use.
